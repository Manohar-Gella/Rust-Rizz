# RustInPeace

Welcome to **RustInPeace**, where Rust projects come to decay in elegance and efficiency. This is the final resting place for all your Rust-based creations, awaiting the sweet embrace of oblivion.

## Projects Interred Here

### RustyReaper
A Rust tool to harvest your dead code and send it to the afterlife. Efficiently cleans up and disposes of the unnecessary clutter in your projects.

### RustTomb
A library for entombing your most valuable data securely. Rest assured, your secrets are buried six feet deep and sealed away from prying eyes.

### RustDecay
A simulation of entropy and decay, written in Rust. Watch as perfectly organized data slowly succumbs to the inevitable rot.

## Getting Started

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RustInPeace.git
    cd RustInPeace
    ```

2. **Install the Necessary Tombstones**
    Make sure you have Rust installed. If not, follow the [official instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

    ```
